In this article I'd like to share how to make an elegant Vim with simple configurations. The purpose of the post is not to convert you to a Vim enthusiast, but I hope after a glance it will make Vim sound/look more appealing.

# Installation

To begin with, the [Vim official site](https://www.vim.org/download.php){:target='_blank'} provides a few different ways to download and install Vim on your machine. The recommended way is to compile from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
cd vim
./configure --with-features=huge --enable-cscope --enable-multibyte \
    --enable-pythoninterp --enable-python3interp \
    --with-python3-config-dir=PATH_TO_PYTHON3_CONFIG_DIR \
    --enable-fail-if-missing \
    --prefix=PATH_TO_EXEC_DIR
```

where `PATH_TO_PYTHON3_CONFIG_DIR` is usually under `/usr/lib` (i.e. `/usr/lib/python3.7/config-3.7m-darwin`) and `PATH_TO_EXEC_DIR` is the place of the compiled executables. 

# Extension Manager

Assuming we have Vim successfully installed with python supports. Before we move on to those powerful extensions, we first need to have a good extension manager to make our life much easier for future package installation and management. There are a couple of good extension managers for Vim, but I highly recommend [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim){:target="_blank"} since it's easy to use and has lots of supports/discussions online. To install Vundle, 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Then, open the `.vimrc` file under your *home directory* (if it does not exist, just creat a new one) and add the following to the file:
```vim
set nocompatible
filetype off

set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
call vundle#end()
filetype plugin indent on
```

And then, open Vim, and run
```
:PluginInstall
```

And congratulations! We have Vundle successfully installed. From now on, we can easily install and manage Vim extensions with Vundle.

# Useful Extensions
Next, I'll recommend a few plugins that can improve the appearance or enhance our efficiency. Normally, we install an extension by adding the following lines in `.vimrc` *after* the lines for configuring Vundle:

```vim
Plugin '<path_to_extension>'
```
and then in Vim run
```
:PluginInstall
```

You may run the latter once for multiple packages.

## Functionality
### Code Folding
Current text editors provide the ability to collapse a block of code to make it easier to browse through the entire file. [SimplyFold](https://github.com/tmhedberg/SimpylFold){:target="_blank"} is an extension that enables code folding and expansion in Vim. To install, add the following to `.vimrc`:

```vim
Plugin 'tmhedberg/SimpylFold'
``` 

and you may refer to their documentation for advanced configurations. The command to collapse the code is `zc` and to expand is `zo`.

<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
  <div class="cell cell--8"> <div class="card">
  <div class="card__image">
    <img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/blogs/blog3/codefolding.gif"/>
  </div>
  <div class="card__content">
    <div class="card__header">
      <h4>Code folding</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 
</div>
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
</div>

### Commenter
[NERD Commenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter){:target="_blank"} is a powerful tool to comment/uncomment your code. To install, add 
```vim
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'
```
to your `.vimrc`. I personally use the following configuration for the tool:
```vim
filetype plugin on
" Add spaces after comment delimiters by default
let g:NERDSpaceDelims = 1
" Use compact syntax for prettified multi-line comments
let g:NERDCompactSexyComs = 1
" Align line-wise comment delimiters flush left instead of following code indentation
let g:NERDDefaultAlign = 'left'
" Set a language to use its alternate delimiters by default
let g:NERDAltDelims_java = 1
" Add your own custom formats or override the defaults
let g:NERDCustomDelimiters = { 'c': { 'left': '/**','right': '*/' } }
" Allow commenting and inverting empty lines (useful when commenting a region)
let g:NERDCommentEmptyLines = 1
" Enable trimming of trailing whitespace when uncommenting
let g:NERDTrimTrailingWhitespace = 1
" Enable NERDCommenterToggle to check all selected lines is commented or not 
let g:NERDToggleCheckAllLines = 1
map <F4> <leader>ci <CR>
```
and we're now ablt to use the key <F4> to comment/uncomment your code.

<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
  <div class="cell cell--8"> <div class="card">
  <div class="card__image">
    <img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/blogs/blog3/commenter.gif"/>
  </div>
  <div class="card__content">
    <div class="card__header">
      <h4>Commenter</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 
</div>
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
</div>
### Auto Pairing
Vim allows using <CR-n> for word suggestions in the insert mode and <CR-x><CR-f> for path suggestions. However, there are a few useful extensions that can boost up the autocompletion.

[auto-pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs){:target='_blank'} is a tool that may autocomplete pairs of parentheses, brackets, etc under insertion or deletion. Add the following to `.vimrc`:

```vim
Plugin 'jiangmiao/auto-pairs'
```

and you may checkout the website for further configuration.

### Auto-complete
[TabNine](https://tabnine.com/){:target='_blank'} is an awesome tool for autocompletion and it is based on [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe){:target='_blank'}, another powerful tool. I would recommend TabNine mainly because it's easier than YouCompleteMe to install and configure, and a deep-learning based version for TabNine would come out soon (so that it automatically writes code for you!). To install, simply add to `.vimrc`
```vim
Plugin 'zxqfl/tabnine-vim'
```

### File Tree
[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree){:target='_blank'} is a plugin for file system explorer for Vim. Add to your `.vimrc`

```vim
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
```

Here is my configuration for the plugin:
```vim
map <F2> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
let NERDTreeChDirMode=1
let NERDTreeShowBookmarks=1
let NERDTreeIgnore=['\~$', '\.pyc$', '\.swp$']
let NERDTreeWinSize=25
```

and we can display/hide the file tree with key <F2>.

<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
  <div class="cell cell--8"> <div class="card">
  <div class="card__image">
    <img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/blogs/blog3/nerdtree.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="card__content">
    <div class="card__header">
      <h4>NERDTree</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 
</div>
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
</div>



### Script Header
[vim-header](https://github.com/alpertuna/vim-header){:target='_blank'} is a tool that helps us easily add author and license information to the scripts. Add 
```vim
Plugin `alpertuna/vim-header`
```

to your `.vimrc`, and you can checkout detailed usage from their documentation.

## Appearance
### Color Theme
I personally prefer [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox){:target='_blank'} as the primary color scheme. To install, add to `.vimrc`
```vim
Plugin 'morhetz/gruvbox'
``` 

and add the following to enable and configure the theme:
```vim
colorscheme gruvbox
syntax enable
set background=dark
" hot key F5 toggle background
map <F5> :call ToggleBGD()<CR>
function ToggleBGD()
    set background=light
endfunction
map <S-F5> :call ToggleBGL()<CR>
function ToggleBGL()
    set background=dark
endfunction
```

<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
  <div class="cell cell--8"> <div class="card">
  <div class="card__image">
    <img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/blogs/blog3/gruvbox.gif"/>
  </div>
  <div class="card__content">
    <div class="card__header">
      <h4>Gruvbox: switching between dark and light</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 
</div>
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
</div>

The hotkey setting above allows to switch between dark and light mode with <F5> and <S-F5>(shift-F5). There might be a few additional configuration required depending on your system and terminal, and the documentation provides examples of common mistakes and solutions. For instance, you might have to set 
```
export TERM=xterm-256color
``` 

in your bash source file (i.e., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`) to have the color map appropriately displayed, and add
```vim
set t_ut=
```
in `.vimrc` to have it work properly in tmux.

### Status Line
[vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes){:target='_blank'} is an extension to enhance the appearance of the status bar. To install, add to `.vimrc`

```vim
Plugin 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plugin 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
```

and configure it as following to make it consistent with your color theme
```vim
let g:airline_theme='gruvbox'
```


<div class="grid">
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
  <div class="cell cell--8"> <div class="card">
  <div class="card__image">
    <img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/blogs/blog3/airline2.png"/>
    <img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/blogs/blog3/airline1.png"/>
  </div>
  <div class="card__content">
    <div class="card__header">
      <h4>Airline theme with gruvbox</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 
</div>
  <div class="cell cell--2"></div>
</div>

# Additional Settings
There are a few other settings that make your Vim more user-friendly. Here are some of my recommendations, which could be inserted to the beginning of your `.vimrc`:
```vim
" display line number
set nu
" enable mouse in an xterm
set mouse=a
" highlight the search item
set hlsearch
" set backspace button to work as in other programs
set backspace=2
" set font
set guifont=Monaco:h13
" highlight the line and column where the cursor is at
set cursorline
set cursorcolumn
" ignore case in search
set ignorecase
" to always display status line
set laststatus=2
" indentation and tabs
filetype plugin indent on 
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab
```

Sections above introduce an incomprehensive, custom configuration of Vim that makes it look and function as most of the graceful modern text editor or IDE. Don't forget to run `:Plugin Install` after the configuration, and hope you all enjoy the journey with Vim!
